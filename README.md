# openwrt-dsl-graph
Additional files to add a DSL spectrum graph page to OpenWRT.

The page is included in the Status dropdown menu and appears
as 'DSL line statistics'

The graphs are built using the chart.js packages which is 
downloaded from the Cloudflare CDN. If required this can be
changed to local storage.
