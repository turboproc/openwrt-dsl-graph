# openwrt-dsl-graph
Additional files to add a DSL spectrum line statistics graph to OpenWRT.

The page is included in the Status dropdown menu and appears as 
'DSL line statistics'

The graphs are built using the chart.js. A local copy of it chart.min.js
is included. This will allow the graph to be rendered even in an offline
situation.

Example of the graph is shown below
